                            MOSCOW â€” President Petro Poroshenko said Monday that he is introducing martial law across Ukraine for 30 days, starting Wednesday.
                            The move comes one day after Russian ships fired at and seized Ukrainian vessels in the Black Sea, triggering a sharp escalation in tensions between the neighboring countries. Several Ukrainian sailors were injured, and 24 were detained.
